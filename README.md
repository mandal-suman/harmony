## Overview

Harmony is a comprehensive productivity and goal tracking application developed as part of our university's SIP (Summer Internship Program) project. This frontend-focused application helps users manage their tasks, goals, habits, and productivity metrics through an intuitive interface.

### Key Highlights

- Frontend-only implementation with JavaScript-based authentication
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- 15+ pages covering all aspects of a productivity application

## Features (Frontend Only)

### Core Functionality
- **Goal Tracking**: Set and monitor progress toward personal objectives
- **Task Management**: Organize daily tasks with priorities and due dates
- **Habit Tracker**: Build positive routines with streak tracking
- **Productivity Analytics**: Visualize your performance with charts and metrics

### Special Features
- Frontend authentication system with JavaScript validation
- Responsive dashboard with progress visualization
- Comprehensive resource section (tutorials, webinars, help center)

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Technologies
